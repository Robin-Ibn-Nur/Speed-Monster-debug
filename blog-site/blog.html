            <h1>Storage</h1>
            <p>We use the website regularly. During the use of the website, some data remains in our browser.
            </p>
            <p> <b>2 types of data are stored in our browser.</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
                    <p>Local Storage permanently stores the data of all the websites we browse in our browser.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Session Storage</h3>
                    <p>Session Storage stores our single tab's data. After that, the Session Storage becomes empty as
                        soon as the tab is
                        closed. Session Storage is deleted as soon as the tab is closed.</p>

            <h1>Scope</h1>
            <p>The scope of a variable defines where it's accessible in a program based on where it was created. Just
                because we create
                a variable in one place in our program doesn't mean it's going to be accessible from anywhere in our
                script.</p>
            <p><b>There are 2 types of variable scope will be disscussed.</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Global Scope</li>
                <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets {} are known as global variables and
                    have global scope.
                    Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
                    conditional state
                    can access that variable.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> It is not a good practice to use global variables when they are not needed as every code
                    block will have access to
                    those variables.</p>
                <p>The keyword <b>var</b> is used to define Global variable</p>
                <li>Local Scope</li>
                <p>If we have to define some variables inside curly brackets {} or inside a specific function then
                    those variables are
                    called local variables. The local variables have a very confined scope which is called the local
                    scope But, with the
                    release of ES6, the local scope was further broken down into two different scopes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Function scope</li>
                    <p>The function scope is the accessibility of the variables defined inside a function, these
                        variables cannot be accessed
                        from any other function or even outside the function in the main file.</p>
                    <p><b>However</b>, if we try to access this variable outside of the function then we get an error:
                    </p>
                    <li>Block scope.</li>
                    <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                        variables inside the
                        curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                        something else. We are only
                        allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}</p>
                    <p>The keywords <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are used to define block variables.</p>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h1>JS even Loop</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript can do only one thing at
                a single point
                in time.</p>

            <p>The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. It creates the
                execution
                contexts, pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution phase.</p>

            <p>If a function takes a long time to execute, we cannot interact with the web browser during the
                function's execution
                because the page hangs.</p>

            <p></p> function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking
            function blocks all
            the interactions on the webpage, such as mouse click</p>

            <h1>Undefine</h1>
            <p>In JavaScript, three properties, <b>undefined</b>, <b>null</b>, and <b>NAN</b></p>
            <p>The undefined property in JavaScript suggests that a variable has not been assigned a value or not
                declared at all. The
                global undefined property describes the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's primitive
                data types.

            </p>
            <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the
                variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A method returns undefined if a value
                was not
                returned.</p>
            <p>To check if the value is undefined in JavaScript, use the typeof operator. The typeof operator returns a
                string
                indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. Use typeof operator with if condition and compare the
                value of the
                variable using undefined, and you will get your result</p>
            <code>if (typeof data === "undefined") { <br>
                console.log("data is undefined") <br>
                } else { <br>
                console.log("data is defined")
                }</code> <br> <br>
            <output>data is undefined</output>
            <p>In this example, we are checking if the data variable is undefined or not. We have not assigned any value
                to a data
                variable previously, so it returns undefined. The undefined comes into a picture when any variable is
                defined already
                but has not been assigned any value.</p>
